                <h4>1. Meet in Safe Locations</h4>
                <p>Always meet the buyer or seller in a public, well-lit, and busy area. Avoid meeting at secluded spots, especially if you're meeting someone for the first time. Consider meeting at local cafes or parking lots that are secure and have a lot of foot traffic.</p>

            <div class="list-group-item">
                <h4>2. Verify the Vehicle’s Details</h4>
                <p>Before purchasing any vehicle, ensure that the seller provides accurate information about the vehicle’s history, ownership, and condition. Check the vehicle’s registration details, verify its ownership, and ask for maintenance records. Use trusted services to verify the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and ensure it matches the information on the registration.</p>

                <h4>3. Avoid Paying in Cash</h4>
                <p>Whenever possible, use a secure method of payment such as a bank transfer or an escrow service. Avoid paying in cash for large transactions as it’s difficult to trace. Be wary of sellers asking for payment upfront without allowing you to inspect the vehicle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list-group-item">
                <h4>4. Inspect the Vehicle Thoroughly</h4>
                <p>Always inspect the vehicle before finalizing any sale. If you are not familiar with vehicles, consider taking a mechanic with you to ensure the vehicle is in good condition. Look for any signs of damage, unusual wear, or signs of tampering.</p>

            <div class="list-group-item">
                <h4>5. Test Drive the Vehicle</h4>
                <p>If you're buying a used vehicle, always take it for a test drive. This will give you a feel for the vehicle’s condition and help identify any potential issues. Ensure the vehicle is roadworthy and handles well.</p>

                <h4>6. Beware of Fraudulent Listings</h4>
                <p>Be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true. Scammers often offer vehicles at unrealistically low prices to lure in buyers. Always be suspicious of sellers who push you to make a quick decision or demand large upfront payments.</p>

            <div class="list-group-item">
                <h4>7. Secure Your Personal Information</h4>
                <p>When communicating with buyers or sellers, avoid sharing unnecessary personal information such as your home address or financial details. Keep all sensitive information private until you are sure about the legitimacy of the deal.</p>

            <div class="list-group-item">

                <h4>10. Beware of Phishing and Scams</h4>
                <p>Scammers may attempt to trick you into clicking on suspicious links or emails. Always double-check the URL to ensure it’s from a legitimate source. Never share your account details, passwords, or credit card information unless you are confident it’s a secure transaction.</p>

                <h4>11. Bring a Friend or Family Member</h4>
